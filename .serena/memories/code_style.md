# Code Style & Conventions

- Language: JavaScript userscript (no build system observed).
- Pattern: IIFE with `'use strict'` at top; helper functions + `CategoryManager` class.
- Comments: Frequent, detailed Traditional Chinese; section dividers with ASCII banners.
- Naming: camelCase for functions/vars; PascalCase for classes; descriptive method names.
- Logging: `console.log`/`console.error` with `[Shopline Category Manager]` prefix.
- UI strings: Traditional Chinese labels (e.g., "移動到").
